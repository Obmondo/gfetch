Implement the following plan:

# Enhance `SanitizeName` to Handle All Non-Alphanumeric Characters

## Context

`SanitizeName` in `pkg/gsync/openvox.go` converts Git ref names into Puppet environment directory names. Puppet environments only allow `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`. Currently the function only replaces `-` and `.` with `_`, but Git branch names can contain `/` (e.g., `feature/login`), `@`, `~`, `^`, `+`, spaces, and other characters. A branch like `feature/my-branch` would currently create a nested subdirectory instead of a flat sanitized name.

## Changes

### 1. Rewrite `SanitizeName` (`pkg/gsync/openvox.go:26-30`)

Replace `strings.NewReplacer` with `strings.Map` using an allowlist approach — any character not in `[a-zA-Z0-9_]` becomes `_`:

```go
// SanitizeName converts a Git ref name into a valid Puppet environment name.
// Puppet environments only allow [a-zA-Z0-9_]. Any character outside this set
// is replaced with an underscore.
func SanitizeName(name string) string {
	return strings.Map(func(r rune) rune {
		if (r >= 'a' && r <= 'z') || (r >= 'A' && r <= 'Z') || (r >= '0' && r <= '9') || r == '_' {
			return r
		}
		return '_'
	}, name)
}
```

This is a superset of current behavior — all existing replacements still hold, plus `/`, `@`, and everything else is now handled. No import changes needed.

### 2. Add test cases (`pkg/gsync/openvox_test.go`)

Add to `TestSanitizeName` table (lines 12-22):
- `"feature/my-branch"` → `"feature_my_branch"` (forward slash)
- `"bugfix/auth/login"` → `"bugfix_auth_login"` (nested slashes)
- `"user@domain"` → `"user_domain"` (at sign)
- `"release/v1.0.0-rc1"` → `"release_v1_0_0_rc1"` (mixed)
- `"branch~1"` → `"branch_1"` (tilde)
- `"branch^2"` → `"branch_2"` (caret)
- `"my branch"` → `"my_branch"` (space)
- `"a//b"` → `"a__b"` (consecutive slashes → consecutive underscores)

Add to `TestDetectCollisions` (after line 70):
- Slash vs hyphen collision: `"feature/auth"` and `"feature-auth"` both sanitize to `"feature_auth"`

### No other changes needed

- `detectCollisions` already calls `SanitizeName` — works automatically
- All callers (`syncOneOpenVoxBranch`, `syncOneOpenVoxTag`) are unchanged
- No new imports

## Verification

```bash
go test ./pkg/gsync/... -run "TestSanitizeName|TestDetectCollisions" -v
go test ./...
```
