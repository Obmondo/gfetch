Implement the following plan:

# Plan: Add `openvox` config key

## Context

gfetch currently syncs each repo into a single `local_path` directory with all branches/tags as git refs. For Puppet/OpenVox environment management, each branch/tag needs to be a **separate directory** with sanitized names (hyphens and dots replaced with underscores). This feature adds an `openvox` boolean to the YAML config that enables this behavior.

## Design

When `openvox: true`, instead of one git repo at `local_path`:
- A separate git repo is created per branch/tag at `local_path/{sanitized_name}/`
- Each repo fetches only its specific ref and checks it out as a working tree
- Name sanitization: `-` and `.` become `_` (e.g., `feature-branch` → `feature_branch`, `v1.0.0` → `v1_0_0`)
- The `checkout` field is ignored (warning logged) since every ref gets its own checkout

```
local_path/
├── production/          # branch "production" checked out
├── feature_auth/        # branch "feature-auth" checked out
├── v1_0_0/              # tag "v1.0.0" checked out
└── v2_0_0/              # tag "v2.0.0" checked out
```

Each subdirectory is a standalone git repo (uses go-git, no CLI dependency).

## Key Reuse Strategy

The openvox per-ref sync **reuses existing functions** rather than reimplementing:

- **`ensureCloned(ctx, subRepoConfig, auth)`** (`syncer.go:192`) — called with a shallow copy of `RepoConfig` where `LocalPath` is set to `local_path/{sanitized}/`. Handles init + remote creation.
- **`syncBranch(ctx, repo, branch, url, auth, name, log)`** (`branch.go:19`) — fetches a single branch with narrow refspec and updates local ref. Called per branch in each subdirectory repo.
- **`checkoutRef(repo, refName, log)`** (`branch.go:82`) — checks out branch or tag and hard-resets worktree. Called after sync to populate the working directory.
- **Tag fetch** — for tags, a single-tag fetch + `checkoutRef` (simple inline, ~10 lines) since `syncTags` does bulk operations unsuitable for per-directory repos.
- **`resolveBranches(ctx, repo, patterns, auth)`** (`syncer.go:214`) — lists remote branches matching patterns. Used with the resolver repo.
- **`resolveAuth(repo)`** (`auth.go:14`) — unchanged.

The **only new logic** is:
- `SanitizeName()` — string replacer
- `syncRepoOpenVox()` — orchestrator that creates sub-configs and delegates to existing functions
- `ensureResolverRepo()` — bare repo at `.gfetch-meta/` for listing remote refs
- `resolveTags()` — like `resolveBranches` but for tags (the existing `syncTags` merges resolution + fetch)
- Collision detection + directory pruning

## Changes

### 1. Config: `pkg/config/config.go` ✅ (already done)
- Add `OpenVox bool` field to `RepoConfig` struct
- In `Validate()`: warn if both `openvox` and `checkout` are set; skip checkout validation in openvox mode

### 2. New file: `pkg/sync/openvox.go` (needs refactor)
- `SanitizeName(name string) string` — replaces `-` and `.` with `_`
- `syncRepoOpenVox(ctx, repo, opts) Result` — main openvox sync flow:
  1. Create resolver repo at `local_path/.gfetch-meta/`
  2. Resolve matching branches via `resolveBranches()` + tags via `resolveTags()`
  3. Detect name collisions after sanitization
  4. For each branch: build sub-config → `ensureCloned()` → `syncBranch()` → `checkoutRef()`
  5. For each tag: build sub-config → `ensureCloned()` → single-tag fetch → `checkoutRef()`
  6. Pruning: scan `local_path` dirs, remove stale ones
- `ensureResolverRepo()` — bare repo for remote ref listing
- `resolveTags()` — tag equivalent of `resolveBranches()`
- `detectCollisions()` / `pruneOpenVoxDirs()` — unchanged from current draft

### 3. Sync integration: `pkg/sync/syncer.go` ✅ (already done)
- In `SyncRepo()`, if `repo.OpenVox`, delegate to `s.syncRepoOpenVox()` and return

### 4. Tests: `pkg/sync/openvox_test.go` ✅ (already done)
- Unit tests for `SanitizeName`
- Test collision detection

## Verification
1. `go build ./...` — compiles
2. `go test ./...` — passes
3. Manual test with `config.yaml` adding `openvox: true` to a repo entry
